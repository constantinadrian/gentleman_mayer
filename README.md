- #### Surface

    -  ##### Colour Scheme

        - Palette:

            - The colors from palette colors were selected to match the Hero image background from the Home page

            ![Palette Colors](readme_file/Palette-Coolors.png)

    -  ##### Typography

        - For this project, I choose three types of Google Fonts: 'Montserrat', 'Oswald' and 'Raleway'.
       
            For the consistency:

                - 'Montserrat' fonts were used for the header, subheader, links, and all other paragraphs within the page.

                - 'Oswald' fonts were used for the section titles and brand names

                - 'Raleway' fonts were used for the product description and reviews

    -  ##### Imagery

        - Because imagery is important I have carefully chosen the background hero image on the landing page, so can easily reflect the website purpose right from the start

- ### Deployment

  - #### Heroku

    - The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps:

        1. In order to deploy to Heroku you need an [account](https://signup.heroku.com/login?redirect-url=https%3A%2F%2Fid.heroku.com%2Foauth%2Fauthorize%3Fclient_id%3Dd2ef2b24-e72c-4adf-8506-28db2218547d%26response_type%3Dcode%26scope%3Dglobal%252Cplatform%26state%3DSFMyNTY.g2gDbQAAADFodHRwczovL2Rhc2hib2FyZC5oZXJva3UuY29tL2F1dGgvaGVyb2t1L2NhbGxiYWNrbgYAnwF4L3kBYgABUYA.q2PQc0k53ICJ0LR6VFKbOkyuEqmEtG0iuVzTM38UNAI)

        2. Now you can create a new app from the dashboard ``` New``` Menu
        ![](static/readme/heroku-app.jpg)

        3. Now you need to set up a name and select a region closest to you

            NOTE: Remember the name has to be unique and generally use a dash and lowercase letters

        4. On the ```Resources``` tab we gonna provision a new Postgres Database that will go used for this project:

            a. On the ```Add-ons``` search for Heroku Postgres and click on it

            b. On the pop-up window select the free plan ```Hobby Dev - Free``` and click ```Submit Order Form```

        5. To use Heroku Postgres go back to the project install the two dependencies:

            ```
              pip3 install dj_database_url
              pip3 install psycopg2-binary
            ```

        6. On your project create ```requirements.txt``` file that contains a list of our Python dependencies by typing in the terminal 
        
            ```
            pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
            ```

        7. Now on your ```settings.py``` file  ```import dj_database_url``` and in the database settings comment out the current DATABASES settings and replace the default DATABASES with the following settings:

            ```
            DATABASES = {
                'default': dj_database_url.parse('DATABASE_URL')
            }
            ```

            NOTE: The ```DATABASE_URL``` we can get from Heroku, an app that you just created, under the ```Settings``` tab on ```Reveal Config Vars```

        8. Since now we are connected to Heroku Postgres we need to run migrations again, and we can see that with:


            ```
            python3 manage.py showmigrations
            ```

              NOTE: At this stage, you might get an error 
            
            ```
            django.db.utils.OperationalError: FATAL:  role "" does not exist on heroku postgres
            ```

              since in the Full Template, from Code Institute, there is a PGHOSTADDR local variable that has been added to accommodate for the new SQLAlchemy lessons. In order to run showmigrations and migrate after we need to run the terminal this command:

            ```
            unset PGHOSTADDR
            ```

            and after run again to see that none of the migrations are marked off:

            ```
            python3 manage.py showmigrations
            ```

        9. Now run the following command to apply all the migrations and get our Heroku Postgres database set up:

            ```
            python3 manage.py migrate
            ```

        10. Now we can use our fixture again by loading the categories:

            ```
            python3 manage.py loaddata categories
            ```

        11. Following by loading the products:

            ```
            python3 manage.py loaddata products
            ```

            IMPORTANT NOTE: We need to load data in this order because the products depend on the categories already existing

        12. Now we can create a superuser so we can log in with

            ```
            python3 manage.py createsuperuser
            ```

        13. Since our database in Heroku is all set up, we gonna have an if statement in ```setting.py``` to set the ```DATABASES```
        so when we run on Heroku we are gone use the environment variable ```DATABASE_URL``` to connect to Postgres else we gonna connect for SQLite

            NOTE: That at I remain the ```DATABASE_URL``` variable to ```MAYER_DATABASE_URL``` near the end of the project. Check settings.py

            ```
            if 'MAYER_DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
                DATABASES = {
                    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('MAYER_DATABASE_URL'))
                }
            else:
                DATABASES = {
                    'default': {
                        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
                    }
                }
            ```

        14. In order for the deployment to work we need to install another package qunicorn, which will act as our web server:


            ```
            pip3 install gunicorn
            ```

        15. Now we need to freeze that package in our requirements file:
        
            ```
            pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
            ```

        16. Create ```Procfile``` file that tells Heroku to create a web Dyno which will run gunicorn and serv our Django app
            ```
            echo web: gunicorn <app-name>.wsgi:application > Procfile
            ```

        17. Now we need to connect to Heroku from the terminal: 
            ```
            heroku login -i
            ```
        18. Temporarily disable COLLECTSTATIC, because we don't want our static file when we deploy, since we are gone use AWS for that
            ```
            heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app <app-name>
            ```
        19. Now we need to add the hostname of our Heroku app to allowed hosts in ```setting.py```

            ```
            ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['<app-name>.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
            ```


        20. Now add a variable into Heroku app, settings under Reveal Config Vars:

            | Key                            |    Value                    |
            | :----------------------------- | :-------------------------: |
            | HOST_EMAIL_PASS                |  < Gmail app password >     |
            | HOST_EMAIL_USER                |  < Gmail email address >    |
            | MAYER_SECRET_KEY               |  < Django Secret key >      |

        21. Now we can push to GitHub with:

            ```
            git add .

            git commit -m "[Heroku] Deploy to Heroku"

            git push
            ```      

        22. And to finally push to Heroku:

            ```
            heroku git:remote -a <heroku app-name>
            git push heroku master
            ```

            NOTE: We needed to initialize our Heroku git remote because we created our app on the website 

    - Set up the app for automatically deployed for when we push to GitHub:

        1. Go to your app in Heroku

        2. On the ```Deploy``` tab and on each section: 
        
            a. ``` Deployment method``` - set it to Connect to Github

            b. ```Connect to Github``` - search for your repository and click connect

            c. ```Automatic deploys``` - Enable Automatic Deploys
      
  - #### Amazon AWS

    - For this project, Amazon AWS was used to store static and media files.

        1. Create an account to [Amazon AWS](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start)
 
            a. Fill in the email, password and choose a username for the account and select ```Continue```
            
            b. Choose the ```Account type``` Personal and fill in the requirements information and select ```Create Account and Continue```

            c. Fill in the Credit card details which will be used for billing in case you go above the free usage limits, but you won't go anywhere near them with this project

            NOTE: Amazon AWS is not a free service if you go above the free usage limits

        2. Create S3 Bucket

            a. After you log in you can find the S3 by searching on the ```Services``` Menu

            b. Open the S3 and create a Bucket by naming it to much your Heroku app name, select a region closest to you and uncheck the ```Block all public access``` and acknowledge that the bucket will be public since we are allowing public access to our static and media file

            c. Now click ```Create Bucket``` 

        3. Set S3 Bucket

            a. Go into the S3 Bucket that you just created

            b. Go on the ```Properties``` tab and click edit on ```Static website hosting```, enable the Static website hosting and fill in the default values for index and error document and Save

            c. Now go on the ```Permissions``` tab

            - Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) - click edit and paste the following code, which is gone set require access between Heroku app and S3 Bucket:


                ```
                [
                    {
                        "AllowedHeaders": [
                            "Authorization"
                        ],
                        "AllowedMethods": [
                            "GET"
                        ],
                        "AllowedOrigins": [
                            "*"
                        ],
                        "ExposeHeaders": []
                    }
                ]
                ```

            - Bucket policy - click the policy generator to create a secure policy for this bucket

                - ```Select Type of Policy``` is S3 Bucket Policy

                - ``` Principal``` - is star ```*```, to allow all principals

                - ```Actions``` - is GetObject

                - ```Amazon Resource Name (ARN)``` - we will copy from the other tab under ```Bucket ARN```, paste it in, click Add Statement, click Generate Policy, and copy the policy into the Bucket Policy Tab

                    - Before we click save to allow access to all our resources in this bucket we add at the end of Resource key ```/*```

                    - "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::bucket_name```/*```"
            
            Access control list (ACL) - click edit

            - and on the ```Everyone (public access)``` click on List and click save

        4. Set Identity and Access Management (IAM) - by searching ```IAM``` on the Services Menu
        
            - From ```Access management``` menu

                a. Create a group for the user - by clicking on ``` User groups``` and Create Group 

                - Create Group by giving a name related to the Heroku app and click next until you create the group as we don't have the policy to attach for this group yet

                b. Create access policy - to give the group access to the s3 bucket we created by clicking on ```Policies``` and Create Policy

                - Now we go to JSON and select ```Import managed policy``` and import a free policy that AWS has pre-build for full access for S3

                - We search for S3 and select ```ÀmazonS3FullAccess``` and click Import

                - Now here I don't want to allow full access to our new bucket with everything in it, so we go to our S3 Bucket on the ```Permissions``` tab on the Bucket policy click edit, and copy the ARN under ```Bucket ARN``` and paste it in the Resource as list:

                    ```
                    "Resource": [
                        "arn:aws:s3:::bucket_name",
                        "arn:aws:s3:::bucket_name/*"
                    ]
                    ```

                    NOTE: The first item in the list is the bucket itself and the second, with the ```/*``` at the end, adds another rule for all files/folders in the bucket

                - Now we can give it a name and a description by clicking ```Review policy```

                c. Attach the policy to the group - by going back to ```User groups```

                - Click on the group that we create earlier

                - Go on the ```Permissions``` tab and click the add permissions and select ```Attach Policies```

                - Search for the policy that we just created and select it

                - Click ```Attach policy``` to attach it to the group

                d. Create a user for the group - by clicking on ```Users```

                - On the user's page click on ```Add users```

                - Give a name and ```Programmatic access```

                - Select Next and put the user in our Group by selecting the group and click till the end to create a user

                - Now ```download .csv``` which will contain the access key and secret access key which we will use to authenticate from our Django app

                    IMPORTANT NOTE: You need to download this ```.csv``` because want we are gone through this process we can't download it again

        5. Connect Django app to S3 Bucket 

            1. In order to connect Django app to S3 we need to install the two dependencies:

                ```
                pip3 install boto3
                pip3 install django-storages
                ```

            2. Now we need to freeze that packages in our requirements file:
            
                ```
                pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
                ```

            3. Now add storage to our install apps in ```settings.py``` since Django needs to know about it

            4. Now we need to set up Django so that in production we use S3 to store our static files and the product images to go there also

                - In project root level create a file called ```custom_storages.py```


                    ```
                    from django.conf import settings
                    from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage


                    class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
                        location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION


                    class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
                        location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION

                    ```


            5. Now to connect Django to S3 we need to add some settings which will tell it which bucket needs to communicate with

                ````
                if "MAYER_USE_AWS" in os.environ:
                    # Cache control
                    AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
                        'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
                        'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
                    }

                    # Bucket Config
                    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = "gentleman-mayer"
                    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = "eu-west-1"
                    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('MAYER_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
                    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('MAYER_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
                    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

                    # Static and media files
                    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
                    STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
                    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
                    MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

                    # Override static and media URLs in production
                    STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
                    MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
                ```

            6. Now add a variable into Heroku app, settings under Reveal Config Vars:

                | Key                            |    Value                    |
                | :----------------------------- | :-------------------------: |
                | MAYER_USE_AWS                  |  True                       |
                | MAYER_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID        |  < AWS Access key ID >      |
                | MAYER_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY    |  < AWS Secret access key >  |

            7. Now we can remove the ```DISABLE_COLLECSTATIC``` variable since Django will collect static files automatically and upload them to S3


  - #### Local Clone

    ##### In order to run this project locally you should have installed:

    1. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - IDE or your personal preference
        
    2. [Pyhton3](https://www.python.org/) - to run the application on your local machine

        Optional: you can install 
        
        - [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - used for version control

    ##### Steps to follow

    1. At the top of the repository click on Code and click on download zip and extract the zip file to your chosen folder or keep the same name

        ![Download zip](readme_file/code-clone.png)

        Optional: if you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) install on your machine you can type

        ```
        git clone https://github.com/constantinadrian/gentleman_mayer
        ```

        or to clone the repository into a different name on the folder you can run 

        ```
        git clone https://github.com/constantinadrian/gentleman_mayer folder_name
        ```

        more info about cloning with git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository).

    2. Create a virtual environment within the project directory to keep dependencies required by the project separate from other projects by creating an isolated Python virtual environment.

        ```
        py -3 -m venv venv
        ```

    3. Activate the environment

        ```
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    4. Install all dependencies from requirements.txt:

        ```
        pip3 install -r requirements.txt
        ```

        Note: For upgrade PIP type this command ```pip3 install --upgrade pip```

    5. Declare default environment variables in a file ```env.py``` 

        ```
        import os  
        os.environ["DEVELOPMENT"] = "True"    
        os.environ["MAYER_SECRET_KEY"] = "< Django Secret key >"
        os.environ["MAYER_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "< Stripe Public key >"    
        os.environ["MAYER_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"] = "< Stripe Secret key >"    
        os.environ["MAYER_STRIPE_WH_SECRET"] = "< Stripe Webhook key >" 
        ```

    6. Add ```env.py``` to your ```.gitignore``` file.

    7. In ```settings.py``` after the imports add the following code:

        ```
        if os.path.exists("env.py"):
            import env
        ```

    8. To create the db.slite3 file run

        ```  
        python manage.py runserver
        ```

        NOTE: At this point, you should see that you have unapplied migration(s).

    9. Now you can stop the server with: ```Ctrl + C```

    10. Now run the following command to apply all the migrations:

        ```
        python manage.py migrate
        ```

    11. Now we can use our fixture by loading the categories:

        ```
        python manage.py loaddata categories
        ```

    12. Following by loading the products:

        ```
        python manage.py loaddata products
        ```

        IMPORTANT NOTE: We need to load data in this order because the products depend on the categories already existing

    13. Now we can create a superuser so we can login with

        ```
        python manage.py createsuperuser
        ```

    14. To run the project run

        ```
        python manage.py runserver
        ```

    15. Website is now available at: http://localhost:8000


        NOTE: If you open the website by clicking on the terminal on http://127.0.0.1:8000/ you will get an error from Django 

        ```
        Invalid HTTP_HOST header: '127.0.0.1:8000'. You may need to add '127.0.0.1' to ALLOWED_HOSTS.
        ```

        Now the last setting added to ```settings.py``` in ```ALLOWED_HOSTS```:

        ```
        ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['gentleman-mayer.herokuapp.com', 'localhost', '127.0.0.1']
        ```

        Now the Website is available at: http://localhost:8000 and at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

    16. After closing the server to close the virtual environment type in the terminal:

        ```
        deactivate
        ```
